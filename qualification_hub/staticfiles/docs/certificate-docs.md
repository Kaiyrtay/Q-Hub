# Certificate Management Application
The Certificate Management Application is part of a Django-based project designed to manage certificates awarded to students and teachers. It allows for creating, updating, viewing, and deleting certificate records, with details about specific certificates, their owners, and related information.

## Purpose
The Certificate Management Application's primary purpose is to provide a structured system for managing certificates awarded to students and teachers. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for certificate management, with role-based permissions to ensure secure access control.

## Key Features
- **Certificate Model**: Represents certificates in the system. It contains attributes such as `certificate_name`, `organization`, `description`, `expiration_date`, `issuing_authority`, `certificate_number`, `verification_url`, and `date_earned`. The model has foreign key relationships with `Student` and `Teacher` to represent ownership.

- **Role-Based Permissions**: The application uses mixins to control access based on user roles. `TeacherOrStudentRequiredMixin` ensures that only teachers or students can create certificates, while `ManagerOrOwnerForCertificateRequiredMixin` enforces permission control for updates and deletions.

- **CRUD Operations**: The app supports CRUD operations for managing certificates, using Django's generic class-based views. This includes creating new certificates, updating existing ones, and deleting certificate records.

- **Secure Deletion**: The `CertificateDeleteView` deletes both the `Certificate` record and related user data if applicable, ensuring comprehensive clean-up. This operation requires manager-level permissions or ownership.

## Structure
The Certificate Management Application consists of several key components:

- **Models**: The `Certificate` model defines the structure of certificate records, including relationships with `Student` and `Teacher` to represent ownership. It uses common Django field types like `CharField`, `TextField`, `DateField`, `URLField`, and `ForeignKey`.

- **Views**: The views manage interactions with the `Certificate` model, allowing users to create, update, list, and delete certificates. They enforce role-based permissions through custom mixins.

- **URLs**: The URL configuration maps the views to specific endpoints, allowing users to access the app's functionality. It uses Django's reverse_lazy for URL management and redirections after specific operations.

- **Templates**: The app includes templates for listing certificates, displaying detailed information, and managing form-based operations. These templates are designed for consistency and customization.

## Dependencies
The Certificate Management Application relies on:

- **Django Framework**: The core framework for building web applications.
- **Django Auth Models**: For managing user-related operations, including user ownership of certificates.
- **Core Mixins**: Custom mixins like `TeacherOrStudentRequiredMixin` and `ManagerOrOwnerForCertificateRequiredMixin` for role-based permissions.
