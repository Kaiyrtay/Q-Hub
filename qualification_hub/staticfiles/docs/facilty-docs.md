# Faculty Management Application
The Faculty Management Application is a component of a larger Django-based project designed to manage academic faculties within an educational institution or organization. It allows administrators and staff to manage information related to faculties, including details, associated users, and related operations.

## Purpose
The Faculty Management Application's primary purpose is to provide a structured system for managing academic faculties. It supports creating, updating, viewing, and deleting faculties. Role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can perform specific operations.

## Key Features
- **Faculty Model**: Represents an academic faculty, with attributes such as `name`, `description`, `dean`, `created_at`, `website`, `contact_email`, and `location`. The `Faculty` model links to the `User` model through a foreign key to represent faculty deans.

- **Role-Based Permissions**: The app uses various mixins to control access based on user roles. `StaffRequiredMixin` ensures only staff-level users can create or update faculties, while `SuperuserRequiredMixin` restricts deletion to superusers.

- **CRUD Operations**: The app supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing faculties. It uses Django's generic class-based views to implement these functionalities.

- **Faculty Relationships**: Faculties can be associated with other entities, such as `Department`. The app provides a detailed view that shows related departments and their count.

- **Secure Deletion**: The deletion of a faculty requires superuser-level permissions, providing an extra layer of security for sensitive operations.

## Structure
The app consists of the following components:

- **Models**: The `Faculty` model defines the structure and attributes of a faculty. It uses common Django field types like `CharField`, `TextField`, and `ForeignKey`.

- **Views**: The views manage interactions with the `Faculty` model, providing operations like listing, creating, updating, and deleting faculties. They rely on Django's generic class-based views and mixins for role-based access control.

- **URLs**: The URL configuration maps views to specific endpoints, allowing users to access the desired functionality. Reverse lazy loading is used for URL redirects after specific operations, such as creating or updating a faculty.

- **Templates**: The app includes templates for listing faculties, displaying detailed information, and managing form-based operations. These templates are customizable and visually consistent with the broader project.

## Dependencies
The Faculty Management Application relies on:

- **Django Framework**: The core framework for building web applications, providing tools for models, views, and templates.
- **Django Auth Models**: Used to manage users and establish relationships between faculties and their deans.
- **Core Mixins**: Custom mixins for enforcing access control based on user roles and permissions.
